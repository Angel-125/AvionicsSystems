The Config File for Avionics Systems may contain the following options.  All values are optional,
with defaults as described.

VerboseLogging - Default False.  Used to enable verbose message logging for diagnostic purposes.

PowerResource - Default "ElectricCharge".  Allows a player to specify a different resource type for power,
so that the fc.HasPower() method will check the correct resource for modded installations that do not use
"ElectricCharge".
