**See AvionicsSystems.cfg on the wiki for the authorative version of the config file.**

The Config File for Avionics Systems may contain the following options.  All values are optional,
with defaults as described.  The config file must be at GameData/AvionicsSystems/PluginData/AvionicsSystems.cfg,
or it will not be loaded.

VerboseLogging - Default False.  Used to enable verbose message logging for diagnostic purposes.

ElectricCharge - Default "ElectricCharge".  Allows a player to specify a different resource type for power,
so that the fc.HasPower() method will check the correct resource for modded installations that do not use
"ElectricCharge".


Global Config Nodes

In addition to the config file, which configures Avionics Systems specifically, there are
several configuration nodes that may be used to extend Avionics Systems functionality.

Color Nodes

Color Nodes are used to define a named color.  A named color allows an IVA designer to specify
instrument colors using a consistent theme, including changing all of the colors by editing a single
location (as opposed to editing every single prop config file).  In addition, these colors can be
overridden on a per-pod basis using nodes in the MASFlightComputer part module (see MASFlightComputer).

These color nodes are defined exactly like RasterPropMonitor color nodes (100% compatibility):

RPM_GLOBALCOLORSETUP
{
	COLORDEFINITION
	{
		name = MOARdV_NASGAUGESCALE_ACTIVECOLOR
		color = 154,149,118,255
	}
	// additional COLORDEFINITION nodes here
}

'name': Required.  Colors are reference in a prop config by prefixing 'COLOR_'
to the name (eg, the color above is referenced as 'COLOR_MOARdV_NASGAUGESCALE_ACTIVECOLOR').

'color': Required.  The RGBA color.

Font Nodes

A Font Node is used to import a bitmap font for use in Avionics Systems.  This feature
is used to allow RasterPropMonitor fonts to be imported, and to allow other customized
bitmap fonts to be used.

MAS_BITMAP_FONT
{
	name = JSI_baseFont
	
	texture = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Fonts/baseFont
	fontDefinition = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Fonts/fontDefinition.txt
	fontSize = 16,32
}

'name': Required.  The name that will be used to reference the font.
'texture': Required.  The URL for the texture that is loaded.
'fontDefinition': Required.  A text file listing the supported characters
in order (left to right, top to bottom in the file).
'fontSize': Required.  Defines the dimensions of each character in the
bitmap file (width, height).
