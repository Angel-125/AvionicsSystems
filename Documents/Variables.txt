Variables in Avionics Systems are defined by Lua or Lua-like functions.  There are many built-in variables,
each prefixed with 'fc.', that provide vessel state.  In addition, there are plugin variables,
each of which are prefixed with a different name (see Supported Plugin Variables).  User-supplied
functions may also be used as variables.  These custom functions may access all the variables in
MOARdV's Avionics Systems, and they may trigger actions as well (however, use caution inserting actions into
variable-evaluating functions - there are better ways to trigger actions).

Any expression that can be placed in a Lua return statement can be used as a variable.  For instance,
if an animation wanted to check whether RCS was engaged, but it wanted a 2 for "on" instead of the
default 1, it could use the expression

variable = fc.GetRCS() * 2

This would return 0 for "off" and 2 for "on".  Other valid Lua expressions could be used as well,
as long as the resulting string would be valid in a Lua "return [variable]" statement.

Special Tokens

Certain special tokens may be inserted into the variable string.

These tokens are replaced by the processor as follows:

%AUTOID% - Generates a per-pod unique id for use in persistent variables.

%MODULEID% - Inserts the module ID (index) of the MASComponent (TBD)

%PROPID% - Inserts the internalProp.propID (index) where found.
