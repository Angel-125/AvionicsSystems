The MASNavBall module is based on the RasterPropMonitor JSINavBall.  It is an
extension of the basic stock navball prop module InternalNavBall that adds an
on-off capability using a specified variable.  It is configured like the stock
InternalNavBall with the addition of up to three additional parameters:

'variable': Required.  Name of the variable that controls when the navball is
enabled.
'range': Optional.  When present, MASNavBall operates in Threshold Mode; otherwise,
MASNavBall operates in Boolean Mode. See MASComponent for definitions of Threshold
Mode and Boolean Mode.
'maxAngle': Optional.  Defaults to 180.  Specifies the maximum slew rate of the
navball in degrees-per-second.
