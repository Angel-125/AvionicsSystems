This directory contains multiple text files that are used to organize the
documentation for MOARdV's Avionics Systems.  They are not authorative or final
documents - those will show up on the MAS Wiki.
You can consider this an off-site backup of my electronic scratchpad.

All text files (.txt extension) in this directory are

forks or downloads for off-line review), but please do not otherwise distribute
them, as they are in-progress drafts.
