This directory contains copies of alexustas' Modular Push Button and Modular Toggle Switch
documents.  These two documents illustrate the options available for configuring push
buttons and toggle switches.

The documents provide example configurations for RasterPropMonitor (since MAS was unavailable
when the documents were created).  However, prop makers should be able to figure out how to
make MAS-compatible configuration files using these documents and referring to the many examples
in the MAS_ASET directory.

Documents distributed with permission of alexustas.
