The MAS "standard library" is a collection of useful functions for writing variables
and custom Lua functions for Avionics Systems.  The methods are all in the Lua
table 'mas', which is available globally.  The functions are described below, along
with example use-cases.

mas.ActionAndVariable(action, persistentVariable)

This method will trigger the action specified and it will toggle the value of the
named persistent variable as a single action.  It returns the new value of the
persistent variable.

Note that 'action' is a variable, not a function invocation (eg, 'fc.ToggleRCS',
not 'fc.ToggleRCS()').  The persistentVariable is a string (such as "%AUTOID%").

mas.Between(value, bound1, bound2)

This method returns 1 if `value` is between `bound1` and `bound2` (inclusive).
It returns 0 otherwise.  The bound variables may be in any order.

mas.BoolToNumber(booleanExpression)

This method returns 1 if booleanExpression is true; it returns 0 otherwise.
Since variables require a numeric return value, this method provides that
mechanism.

mas.Clamp(value, bound1, bound2)

Clamps /value/ to the range specified by /bound1/ and /bound2/.  The bounds
may be in any order.
