MOARdV's Avionics Systems Quick Start Guide

1) Read the FAQ.  Seriously.  I will not provide answers to questions that are
answered in the FAQ.  Asking one of those questions tells me you didn't bother
looking at even that documentation.

2) Delete any existing GameData/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems directory.  I recommend this
approach over copying over an existing installation because sometimes I move
files around, and having multiple copies could have side-effects (cause bugs).

3) Unzip the GameData directory in this zip file into your GameData directory.
The only directory in this zip file's GameData directory is the MOARdV
directory, so telling it to overwrite the existing folder is safe (refer to step
2 above).

4) (Optional) Download and install Module Manager from
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-112-module-manager-2625-may-19th-where-the-singularity-started/ .

Avionics Systems does not require MM to function, but most IVAs use MM to replace
a stock IVA with a MAS-enabled version.  There is a good chance you've installed
MM already, so make sure you have the current version.  It is not included in
the MAS distribution.

If you have installed correctly, the directory structure should look like this:

GameData +
		 + MOARdV +
		          + AvionicsSystems
				  + FlightSystems (maybe)
				  + MAS_ASET
				  + Props
				  + Scripts

The contents of each directory are:
MOARdV/AvionicsSystems : The MAS plugin, the MoonSharp Lua interpreter, and other
 required files.  Delete this, and the mod will not work.
MOARdV/MAS_ASET        : MAS-enabled props using alexustas's ASET Props pack.  These
 DO NOT replace RPM props.  They are the props I use for developing and testing MAS.
 If you are not using one of my MAS-enabled IVAs, you do not have to keep this directory.
MOARdV/FlightSystems   : Config files for MAS-enabled IVAs.  These may or may not be part
 of an official MAS distribution.  If you don't see the directory, there are no IVAs
 included.
MOARdV/Props           : Props developed by alexustas that are not part of his official
 props packs that may be used in my MAS-enabled IVAs.  Like the MAS_ASET directory,
 you do not need to keep this directory if you're not using one of my IVAs.
MOARdV/Scripts         : Lua scripts used by the props in MOARdV/Props.  You can use
 these for reference writing your own scripts, or you can delete them if you're deleting
 the Props directory.
