MOARdV's Avionics Systems Quick Start Guide

1) Read the FAQ.  Seriously.  I will not provide answers to questions that are
answered in the FAQ.  Asking one of those questions tells me you didn't bother
looking at even that documentation.

1a) If you have a previous installation of Avionics Systems and you want to
preserve your config file, back up GameData/AvionicsSystems/PluginData/as.cfg.

2) Delete any existing GameData/AvionicsSystems directory.  I recommend this
approach over copying over an existing installation because sometimes I move
files around, and having multiple copies could have side-effects (bugs).

3) Unzip the GameData directory in this zip file into your GameData directory.
The only directory in this zip file's GameData directory is the AvionicsSystems
directory, so telling it to overwrite the existing folder is safe (refer to step
2 above).

3a) If you backed up your config file, restore it now by overwriting the config
file that was in the zip file.

4) (Optional) Download and install Module Manager from
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-112-module-manager-2625-may-19th-where-the-singularity-started/ .

Avionics Systems does not require MM to function, but most IVAs use MM to replace
an existing IVA with an updated one.  There is a good chance you've installed
MM already, so make sure you have the current version.
