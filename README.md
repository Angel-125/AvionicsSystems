# AvionicsSystems
MOARdV's Avionics Systems for Kerbal Space Program - a new generation of IVA enhancement.

## Short Intro

This is a project to rebuild RasterPropMonitor
from the ground up using the design techniques I retrofitted to RPM during the first half
of 2016.  The goal is to provide a leaner, more performant design without sacrificing
features that are available in RPM.  A longer-winded explanation is available in the
wiki's [Introduction](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/Introduction).

MAS is under intermittent development (basically, when I feel like it and I have time).

The [wiki](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki) contains most of the documentation for this mod, including guides to
configuring props and integrating scripting.

Development builds will appear under [Releases](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/releases) as I have new things to test.

Please understand that any IVA included directly in MAS is 
not guaranteed to be a full-featured IVA ideal for regular gameplay.

## What about RPM?

RasterPropMonitor is in maintenance mode.  I will keep RPM compiling, and I will try to fix any
egregious bugs, but I do not plan to continue developing features for the mod.  It is far too
complex for me to test it adequately by myself in a reasonable time.  As long as RPM is still
in wide use, I will strive to keep it working, but I can not guarantee much beyond that.

IVAs will still work with RPM.  Props packs designed for RPM will still work with RPM.

## Other questions?

Look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/FAQ) on the wiki.  I may have already come up with an answer.  If not, please ask.
