# AvionicsSystems
MOARdV's Avionics Systems for Kerbal Space Program - a new generation of IVA enhancement.

##Short Intro

This is a research and design project (currently) to see if I can rebuild RasterPropMonitor
from the ground up using the design techniques I've retrofitted to RPM during the first half
of 2016.  The goal is to provide a leaner, more performant design without sacrificing
features that are currently available in RPM.  A longer-winded explanation is available
in Documents/Introduction.txt (once I post it; it will be in the formal documentation once that comes
together).

##What about RPM?

If this project works out as intended, RPM will be placed in maintenance mode and future features will be
added to this mod.  I will keep RPM up to date with future KSP updates as long as it's still
in wide use.

##What about mods using RPM?

IVAs will still work with RPM.  Props packs designed for RPM will still work with RPM.

I plan on creating a tool to facilitate upgrading parts packs to MAS, and I expect
that ASET Props will have fully compatible config files.

##When will this happen?

I am actively developing MAS.  As of July 2016, it is still in the very early stages, but
some basic RPM prop features are implemented.

Rudimentary development builds will appear here as I have stuff to test; if you're interested
in testing, PM me on the KSP forum.  I won't be providing support for general
installations during the development phase, so if you want to try it out, feel free. But, if it
doesn't work, you'll have to sort it out yourself.
