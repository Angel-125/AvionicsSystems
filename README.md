# AvionicsSystems
MOARdV's Avionics Systems for Kerbal Space Program - a new generation of IVA enhancement.

## Short Intro

This is a research and design project (currently) to see if I can rebuild RasterPropMonitor
from the ground up using the design techniques I've retrofitted to RPM during the first half
of 2016.  The goal is to provide a leaner, more performant design without sacrificing
features that are currently available in RPM.  A longer-winded explanation is available
in Documents/Introduction.txt (once I post it; it will be in the formal documentation once that comes
together).

## Dev Builds?

Dev Builds are available as releases.  They're updated when I feel it's warranted.  A little more
discussion is over on [the wiki](https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/Dev-Builds).  Please
take heed of the "ATTENTION" paragraph.

## What about RPM?

RasterPropMonitor is in maintenance mode.  I will keep RPM compiling, and I will try to fix any
egregious errors, but I do not plan to continue developing features for the mod.  It is far too
complex for me to test it adequately by myself in a reasonable time.  As long as RPM is still
in wide use, I will strive to keep it working, but I can not guarantee much beyond that.

## What about mods using RPM?

IVAs will still work with RPM.  Props packs designed for RPM will still work with RPM.

## When will this happen?

MAS is under intermittent development (basically, when I feel like it and I have time).

Development builds will appear here as I have stuff to test. If you're interested
in testing, PM me on the KSP forum.  Please understand that any IVA I create during development
will not be a full-featured IVA intended for gameplay.  Ideal testers are people who create
their own IVAs, and people who are not hesistant to tweak prop config files to try things out -
that is, people who can find holes in the MAS design and things I overlooked.

## Other questions?

Look at Documents/FAQ.txt.  I may have already come up with an answer.  If not, please ask.
