The MAS MFD2 multi-function display / flight management system
provides a task-oriented approach to operating orbital space
craft.

Most functions are triggered by pressing one of the soft keys
along the top and bottom of the MFD.  A caption is adjacent to
each enabled soft key, surrounded by a color-coded border.

If a border is [#00ff00]GREEN[#afd3ff], it indicates that the softkey will open
a new page on the MFD.  If the border is [#ffff9b]HIGHLIGHTED[#afd3ff], it
means that the button is active.  If the border is [#839ebf]DIMMED[#afd3ff], it
means that the button may be pressed to make it active.

[#839ebf]DIMMED[#afd3ff] / [#ffff9b]HIGHLIGHTED[#afd3ff] soft keys may be used in one of two ways.
First, they may be used as a toggle, such as switching the
MechJeb Ascent Autopilot on or off.  Second, they may be used
as a group of buttons, such as choosing which scale to apply
when adjusting orbital parameters.

The group of buttons in the lower-right corner of the MFD may
be used for inputs on some pages.  When they are enabled, the
page will display icons near the buttons to hint at what the
buttons will do.

Some pages, such as this one, will have a [#ffff9b]BACK[#afd3ff] softkey in the
lower-right corner.  On those pages, pressing the [#ffff9b]-[#afd3ff] key returns
you to the previous page.
