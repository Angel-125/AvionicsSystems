Yarbrough08 Mk. 1-1 A2 Command Pod README

This IVA uses the Yarbrough08 Mk. 1-1 A2 two seat command pod
(http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/88604-wip-105-2-kerbal-command-pod-mk-1-1-a2-alpha-04-spacedock/).
Note that the command pod and heat shield config files may need fixes, since this pod has not been updated in over
a year.

The Mk. 1-1 A2 Command Pod is the current development platform for MOARdV's
Avionics Systems.  It is the most complete MAS command pod, and it
illustrates some of what is possible in MAS.  Some of those capabilities
are very difficult or impossible to duplicate using RasterPropMonitor.

You will need to install Module Manager and the ASET Props development
build (dev 1.4.3 from 3-May-2017 or later - see the ASET Props thread).
Obviously, you need the Yarbrough08 command pod.

MechJeb is very strongly recommended.  Chatterer and RealChute are
recommended.

A short orientation to the cockpit layout:

Most of the pilot functionality is focused on the left (first IVA) seat.
The second primarily duplicates the first seat's functionality and instruments.

Several sections of the cockpit have separate power switches located near
them (the X-pointer, the FDAI, the IMP/Globus, the clocks, and the MechJeb
data entry panels).

Some of the features to look at in this build:

The instrument backlight is a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch (it's near
the center of the left seat's left side panel).

Action Group buttons do not illuminate if there are no actions assigned
to that group.

The MechJeb control panel (upper center) has a numeric
keypad that allows the crew to type in numbers, and mode buttons
that allow the panel to read from or write to various MJ autopilot
"registers" (launch altitude, launch inclination, Ap, Pe, and Altitude).

Some multi-mode buttons have dimmed backlights on some captions -
for instance, the speed mode button (switch between surface, orbit,
and target) and the FDAI scale buttons illuminate when enabled,
but inactive options are dimmer than the active one.
